{"name":"Intro-to-python","tagline":"This contains files and documentation for the intro to python workshop put on by the physics society at UOIT.","body":"###Overview\r\nThis is an intro to using python. We will go over basic skills and make a program to solve projectile motion problems. You should have Linux installed on your laptop. If you do not and would like to come to this workshop please email info@uoitphysics.ca. \r\n\r\n###Tutorial\r\n\r\nWe will build all of the python scripts from scratch. If you would like to examine the finished products you can download them using the .tar.gz button above. To extract the files run the command \r\n\r\n    $ tar -zxvf SOMETHING.tar.gz\r\n\r\nYou can run python programs in the terminal one of two ways. Use \r\n\r\n    $ python my_python_script.py\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n    $ chmod +x my_python_script.py\r\n    $ ./my_python_script.py\r\n\r\nIf you would like to use the interpreter directly (which is useful to test things quickly) just type \r\n\r\n    $ python\r\n\r\ninto the terminal. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\nHere are some useful resources:\r\n- [Google](https://www.google.ca/)\r\n\r\n- [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)\r\n\r\n- [Python subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/python/)\r\n\r\n- [Learn python subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython)\r\n\r\n- [List of programming projects](http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/wiki/challenges)\r\n\r\n- [Codeacademy python course](https://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
